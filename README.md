### Android Application Fundzilla

### Introduction

FundZilla aims to provide a digital platform to raise money through fundraising campaigns. The platform connects potential donors with fund recipients. Users can choose to create campaigns pitching their ideas by providing a summary of their cause and their fundraising goals. 

Upon logging onto the application, the users see a list of potential campaigns they can choose to donate to along with a short description of the cause and the fundraising goals. The user can then choose to make a donation through the application to the fundraising owner account.

### Business statement

Crowdfunding and fundraising through digital platforms is a hyper growth industry which is booming through the ever-expanding use of digital media and platforms. An estimated 34B $ has been raised by crowdfunding in 2017 alone. The crowdfunding industry is estimated to grow to over 300B $ by 2025

The platform provides individuals and non-profits ability to perform peer-to-peer financial transfers and bypass the costs of traditional instruments like liability and interest. The success of these platforms has spurred the rise of grassroot level non-profit movements and organizations which are heavily dependent on individual contributions due to lack of attractive profit incentives. 

While facilitating the process of the fundraising the platform can choose to monetize the transactions by charging a small percentage of the transaction amount or a flat fee from the users of the platform.


### Technologies used

•	Android studio: IDE to develop and test android applications
•	Firebase: Firebase real-time database was used to create database tables and retrieve and store campaign and user related data. Firebase was used as it is easy to setup and tight integration support from android studio is available. 
•	Google Pay: Google pay integration to retrieve user credit card information. This removes the need for credit card data handling from the application. In addition, google pay offers the promise of easy integration and the default payment method for most android users
•	Stripe: The application uses the Stripe connect platform to create customer accounts and route charges to the eventual campaign owner destination. Stripe also allows platform onboarding with dashboard and user account management tools to target user accounts on the platform and disburse payment amounts to bank accounts
